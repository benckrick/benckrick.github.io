I hold an MS in Political Science from the University of Utah and a BA in Middle East Studies/Arabic from the University of Arkansas. My research explores state transitions from political instability, with a focus on forced migrant return dynamics and authoritarian nostalgia, particularly in the Middle East. I use observational and causal inference methods, integrating fieldwork, surveys, and qualitative interviews, with active projects on Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> </body></html>

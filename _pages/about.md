WEBSITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION 

I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at [Duke University](https://polisci.duke.edu/) studying Security, Peace, and Conflict (IR) and Political Methodology. I hold an MS in Political Science from the University of Utah and a BA in Middle East Studies/Arabic from the University of Arkansas. My research explores state transitions from political instability, with a focus on forced migrant return dynamics and authoritarian nostalgia, particularly in the Middle East. I use observational and causal inference methods, integrating fieldwork, surveys, and qualitative interviews, with active projects on Iraq and Afghanistan.

I am a PhD Candidate in the [Political Science Department](https://polisci.duke.edu/) at Duke University. I study topics at the nexus of International Relations and Comparative Politics. My research explores state transitions from political instability, with a focus on forced migration and authoritarian nostalgia, particularly in the Middle East. I rely on causal inference methods, integrating original data with fieldwork and qualitative interviews. I hold a MS in Political Science from the University of Utah and a BA in Middle East Studies/Arabic from the University of Arkansas.

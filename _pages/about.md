WEBSITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION 

I am a PhD student in Political Science at [Duke University](https://polisci.duke.edu/) studying Security, Peace, and Conflict (IR) and Political Methodology. I received my MS from the University of Utah in Political Science and my BA from the University of Arkansas in Middle East Studies/ Arabic. My research seek to understand the challenges associated with state transitions from political instability with an emphasis on (1) the return dynamics facing forced migrants and (2) authoritarian nostalgia. My geographical focus is primarily the Middle East and I have active projects in Iraq. Methodologically, I employ techniques for observational, causal inference triangulated with fieldwork, surveys, and qualitative interviews.
